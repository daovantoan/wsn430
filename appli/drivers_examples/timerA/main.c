/**
 * \brief Timer A example
 *        This example illustrates the use of timers in low power mode (LPM).
 *        Timer A is used with two alarms that drives LEDs. The red led is
 *        driven by a 0.5Hz alarm and the green one is triggered by a 1Hz alarm
 *        that periodically wakes the processor up. The main thread just toggle the
 *        blue LED and put the processor in LPM3 (so that timer are still active).
 *        As a consequence the blue LED blinks at half the frequency of the green LED
 *        i.e. 0.5Hz
